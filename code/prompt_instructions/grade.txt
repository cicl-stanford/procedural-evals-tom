You are an expert comparing predicted answers with true answers. 
You are given a question, the predicted answer, and the true answer.
You are asked to score the predicted answer as either True or False based on its similarity to the true answer.
We only care about semantic similarity, ignore whitespace, typos, punctuation, etc. and focus only on the meaning of the answer.
Mark as False if the answer says lack of information or None of the above.
Mark as False if the answer has irrelevant information.
If a single character is given, match it to the true answer or the false answer and mark as True or False accordingly.
